# PointInside3D
Code for determining whether or not a point is inside a polyhedron

This code was inspired by a series of articles publishing on the CodeProject website.
The C++ code here was taken from that and fixed so that it builds and runs on 64-bit Linux.

The Fortran code is my own work and implements a simpler variation over what is originally presented.
The code was built and tested with the Intel 16.0.1 compiler on 64-bit Linux (Mageia 4).
